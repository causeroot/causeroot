        <p class="hdr1">CauseRoot is a platform that enables you to submit the
        critical issues you are passionate about, in order to--as a
        community -- discover the best solution and get results.</p>
    </h1>
    <p class="bod">Through semantic breakdown of user based content and voter input, the
issues the community cares most about are identified. Once broken down to
their core causes, we can then determine the most meaningful path to
address the problem at hand. With an identified approach, CauseRoot
crowdfunds the prize purse to award the best solution and to drive attention
to subject areas that are not otherwise economically incentivized. By
participating you make the world a better place-everyone wins.</p>

<p class="cta">Tell us your Cause. We'll get to the Root of it.</p>
<p class="cta2">Let us notify you when we launch!</p>
<p class="ftr">We're in a private Beta phase at the moment, but we would love to keep you updated.</p>
