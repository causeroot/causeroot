                <p class="hdr1">CauseRoot is a platform that enables you to submit the
                critical issues you are passionate about, in order to&ndash;as a
                community&ndash;discover the best solution and get results.</p>
            </h1>
            <p class="bod">Through semantic breakdown of user based content and voter input, the
            issues the community cares most about are identified. Once broken down to
            their core causes, we can then determine the most meaningful path to
            address the problem at hand. With an identified approach, CauseRoot
            crowdfunds the prize purse to award the best solution and to drive attention
            to subject areas that are not otherwise economically incentivized. By
            participating you make the world a better place-everyone wins.</p>

                        <p>In a world of increasing complexity, we need to be smarter about how we address the most pressing issues of our time. Our collaborative platform is designed to enable you to provide your ideas for global change in an informed, efficient, and meaningful way. Our software breaks down submitted issues and their causes to discover equivalent content submitted by different users. By distilling that content, we can create a detailed map of cause and effect interactions for issues of concern. Feeding this information back into the community, users will benefit from the wisdom of the crowd to make an informed problem definition.<br>

                        At CauseRoot, our mission focuses on creating incentive where open market solutions have not yet been demonstrated as lucrative. Crowdfunding discrete tasks that are sourced directly from the popular concerns of the community indicates that these calls to action will be well funded, which allows the tasks to become actionable by talented individuals. Our platform model directs the motivations of the crowd to enable individuals within the crowd to act on them. You now have multiple ways to directly contribute to fixing problems that are most important to you.<br>
