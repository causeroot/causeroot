issues the community cares most about are identified. Once broken down to
their core causes, we can then determine the most meaningful path to
address the problem at hand. With an identified approach, CauseRoot
crowdfunds the prize purse to award the best solution and to drive attention
to subject areas that are not otherwise economically incentivized. By
participating you make the world a better place-everyone wins.

Tell us your Cause. We'll get to the Root of it.

We're in a private Beta phase at the moment, but we would love to keep you updated." />
